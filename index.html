    <a id="background" href="https://github.com" title="As the holiday season kicks off, St. Stephen's Basilica becomes the dazzling centerpiece of one of Budapest's iconic Christmas markets. The fair buzzes with holiday spirit, offering a mix of Hungarian craft, festive décor, and local delicacies, capturing the essence of a traditional Christmas. The Advent Feast—an event held in the weeks leading up to Christmas and part of Hungary's holiday traditions—invites guests to savor dishes like chimney cakes, stuffed cabbage, and goulash soup, while the scent of mulled wine and roasted chestnuts fills the air. A highlight for many is the 3D light show projected onto the basilica's facade, a modern touch that brings this historic structure to life."></a>
