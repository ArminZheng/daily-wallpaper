    <a id="background" href="https://github.com" title="New year, new goals—so why not start by taking a step toward better health? On this National Take the Stairs Day, let's climb into the past. The Great Wall of China, one of the longest humanmade structures in the world, offers the perfect inspiration. Stretching more than 13,000 miles and dating back thousands of years, the ancient marvel in today's picture is a series of fortifications spanning rugged mountains, valleys, and deserts. Featuring steep trenches and watchtowers, parts of it were designed to keep invaders at bay. Hiking the Great Wall offers a unique glimpse into this historical landmark. The experience varies from well-preserved sections like Mutianyu to wild, unrestored parts such as Jiankou. Some steps are so high, they're more like steps on a ladder! Talk about a workout—taking these stairs could rival any modern fitness challenge."></a>
