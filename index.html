In 1845, Congress designated the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November as the day Americans vote for most federal offices. Prior to this, states held elections on a date of their choosing within about a month of early December, which created issues with early and late elections. For convenience and to save money, many elections for state and local offices are also held on Election Day."></a>
