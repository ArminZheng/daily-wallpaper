    <a id="background" href="https://github.com" title="Today, we're floating across the waves, following the ocean currents to Japan. Marine Day—海の日, Umi no Hi in Japanese—is celebrated on the third Monday in July. Japan has 14,125 islands and has over 18,400 miles of coastline, so it's no wonder the sea plays such a key role in its culture. It provides much of the country's food and is vital for trading and communicating with other nations."></a>
