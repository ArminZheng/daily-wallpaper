Centuries later, tea is the second-most consumed drink in the world (after water). Today is International Tea Day, a global nod to this timeless beverage, established by the United Nations to recognize tea's role in reducing poverty and supporting sustainable development. It's a day to honor both the drink and the people who are part of this industry."></a>
