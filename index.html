    <a id="background" href="https://github.com" title="This fiery tumbleweed is kochia, which transforms landscapes when it takes on hues of red, orange, and pink in the fall. In the spring and summer, this annual herb resembles a fluffy green ball. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, kochia, also known as 'summer cypress,' is now widespread throughout the world. But it has a special place in Japan's Hitachi Seaside Park, seen in today's image, where around 30,000–40,000 kochia bushes are planted each year. These ornamental plants create a surreal landscape for visitors to wander through and also hold significance in Japanese culture. Historically, they have been dried to create brooms. However, not all parts of the kochia are destined to sweep the Earth—some are used for food. The plant's nuts, 'tonburi,' often called 'field caviar,' are a prized garnish."></a>
