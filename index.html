    <a id="background" href="https://github.com" title="Strolling through the streets of India during Holi is like stepping into a kaleidoscope of colors—vivid splashes of blue, green, red, yellow, pink, and orange fill the air. This festival falls on the full moon day in the Hindu month of Phalguna—usually in late February or March. It is a significant tradition that symbolizes the arrival of spring and the victory of good over evil. Outside India, Holi is celebrated by Hindus in Nepal, Bangladesh, and Pakistan, as well as by Indian communities around the world, including the US."></a>
