    <a id="background" href="https://github.com" title="Curious about what it's like to be a lion cub living in the wild? Let's explore their life. African lion cubs like those featured here, sunbathing in the wilderness of South Africa, start life tucked away in a secluded den. Blind at birth, these little ones are vulnerable in the first few weeks of their lives and depend entirely on their mothers. At around 8 weeks old, they meet the rest of the pride and learn to socialize so they can find their place in the group. After they hit 6 months, they begin to go out hunting with adults, learning essential skills through real-life adventures."></a>
