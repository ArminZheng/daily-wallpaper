    <a id="background" href="https://github.com" title="Archaeology might not be the first thing that comes to mind when you think of festivals, but the Festival of British Archaeology, July 13-28, is here to change that. Since its inception in 1990, it has evolved into a two-week event. A clever shift from September to July has made it easier for archaeological buffs to explore summer digs and heritage wonders. This year's theme of 'Archaeology and Community' invites enthusiasts across the United Kingdom for an array of in-person and virtual events. Imagine standing amid Skara Brae's ancient stone houses on Scotland's Orkney archipelago, pictured here, where Neolithic settlers thrived over 5,000 years ago. Exposed by an 1850 storm, this prehistoric marvel is dubbed the 'Scottish Pompeii' due to its astonishing preservation—older than Stonehenge and even the Great Pyramids. So, grab your trowel, and get ready to dig deep into the incredible, storied past. Who knows what you'll discover!"></a>
