    <a id="background" href="https://github.com" title="Each January 25, Scots and friends around the world raise a toast to Robert Burns, Scotland's beloved national poet. A Burns Night supper blends warmth and wit: the centerpiece is haggis, a savory pudding made from minced meat, oats, and spices, served with neeps (mashed turnips) and tatties (mashed potatoes). Add plenty of good cheer, readings of Burns's verse, and a dram of whisky, and you have a celebration that ends with a rousing chorus of 'Auld Lang Syne.' Even if you're celebrating stateside, these traditions are easy to adopt—set the table, cue the poetry, and let the toasts flow."></a>
