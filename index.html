    <a id="background" href="https://github.com" title="Today's image features a black caiman, South America's stealthy river giant, in the Tambopata National Reserve of Peru. These caimans are the largest species in the alligator family, growing up to 20 feet and weighing as much as 1,000 pounds. Their dark color helps them blend into the murky depths. These carnivorous creatures thrive in freshwater environments such as slow-moving rivers, lakes, and seasonally flooded savannas. From these waters, they hunt for birds, fish, turtles, and occasionally big mammals. Black caimans play an important role in making sure ecosystems stay balanced by keeping the populations of their prey under control. More caimans mean fewer piranhas, which attack cattle, and fewer capybaras, which can cause crop damage."></a>
