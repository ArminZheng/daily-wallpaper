    <a id="background" href="https://github.com" title="On May 4, 'Star Wars' fans celebrate Star Wars Day, a tribute to the beloved franchise created by George Lucas. The film series consists of nine movies, collectively referred to as the 'Skywalker Saga.' One of the memorable filming locations is Plaza de España in Seville, Spain, as seen in today's image. This beautiful square, with its semi-elliptical shape and stunning architecture, was used as the city of Theed on the planet Naboo. The scene where Senator Amidala arrives in Naboo, featuring Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen, was filmed here. Plaza de España's unique design, with its central building, towers, and fountain, adds a touch of magic to the Star Wars universe. This historic square, designed by Aníbal González, was originally built for the Ibero-American Exposition in 1929."></a>
