    <a id="background" href="https://github.com" title="Nestled within Michigan's Rock River Canyon Wilderness, Rock River Falls emerges amid a landscape shaped by glaciers, dense woods, and layers of history. In the Upper Peninsula, humans have left their traces for millennia: Indigenous Algonquian-speaking peoples were followed by French and British explorers, and waves of Finnish, Swedish, and French-Canadian immigrants settled there during the 19th-century mining and logging booms. Today, this sparsely populated region hosts barely 3% of Michigan's residents, cradling its forests and waterfalls in near-natural serenity."></a>
