    <a id="background" href="https://github.com" title="Ahoy, mateys! It be International Talk Like a Pirate Day. Today, landlubbers and seafarers alike put on their tricorn hats and hoist the Jolly Roger. The day started in 1995 as a joke between two friends, John Baur and Mark Summers, but it got a boost in 2002 after they shared the idea with humorist Dave Barry, who promoted it in his syndicated column. Since then, it's become a day of fun—people don pirate costumes, engage in pirate-themed activities, like the kid on the ship in today's image, and embrace mock pirate language. Whether ye be a seasoned buccaneer or a greenhorn, it's time to batten down the hatches, shiver your timbers, and unleash your inner pirate. Arr!"></a>
