    <a id="background" href="https://github.com" title="Here is a beautiful coastal getaway offering endless fun and adventure—welcome to Ocean City, Maryland. Ocean City was a quiet fishing village until 1875, when the Atlantic Hotel opened its doors, marking the town's transformation into a burgeoning resort destination. Today, it is a popular vacation spot, with an iconic 3-mile-long boardwalk lined with restaurants, shops, and amusement parks. Pristine sandy beaches stretching over 10 miles are perfect for sunbathing, beach volleyball, or building sandcastles, and the ocean waters beckon for a refreshing swim. Ocean City is a charming retreat that draws visitors back time and again."></a>
