    <a id="background" href="https://github.com" title="Imagine a colossal puzzle made from over 2 million stone blocks—that's Borobudur, seen in today's image. Built during the 9th century in the reign of the Shailendra dynasty—an influential ruling family in Southeast Asia—it's the world's largest Buddhist temple, standing tall on the island of Java, Indonesia. This ancient sanctum has withstood centuries of natural challenges, including volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, thanks to its advanced interlocking stone system. Historically, Borobudur was an important pilgrimage site. After being abandoned for centuries, it was rediscovered in the 19th century by the English lieutenant governor Thomas Stamford Raffles."></a>
