    <a id="background" href="https://github.com" title="What was a depleted quarry over a century ago now transforms into a living color wheel each spring. Butchart Gardens in Brentwood Bay, British Columbia, knows how to put on a bloom show. In spring, roses scent the air, tulips line the paths, and something new blooms around every turn. But it didn't always look this way. In the early 1900s, Robert Pim Butchart operated a limestone quarry here. His wife, Jennie, saw potential in the depleted pit and began planting flowers in 1904. Now spread across 55 acres, the garden is home to more than 900 plant species—and each spring, almost 300,000 bulbs bloom."></a>
