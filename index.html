    <a id="background" href="https://github.com" title="Moloka'i, often called the most Hawaiian of the islands, offers a slower rhythm shaped by nature and strong community ties. Formed by volcanic activity more than a million years ago, the island covers about 260 square miles and rises from the Pacific Ocean in long ridges and broad valleys. Unlike its busier neighbors, Moloka'i has resisted large-scale development, preserving a strong sense of local cohesion where families, traditions, and stewardship of the land encapsulate central values. Life here focuses on the ocean, the land, and stories passed down through generations."></a>
