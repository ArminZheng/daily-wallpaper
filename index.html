    <a id="background" href="https://github.com" title="Every holiday season, as snow begins to fall and Christmas lights twinkle in the night, the story of 'The Nutcracker' comes to life on stages around the world. Written by Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky in 1892, this beloved ballet is based on E.T.A. Hoffmann's fairy tale 'The Nutcracker and the Mouse King.' Set on Christmas Eve, it follows a young girl named Clara, who goes on an adventure with the Nutcracker Prince as they battle the evil Mouse King. Many renowned ballet companies present their rendition of this classic every year, including the New York City Ballet, the Boston Ballet, and the English National Ballet, pictured here."></a>
