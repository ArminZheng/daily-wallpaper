    <a id="background" href="https://github.com" title="You don't need to be a bird expert to notice the wheatear darting across open ground. These ground-dwelling songbirds are known for their upright posture and habit of hopping or sprinting between perches. Despite the name, wheatears have nothing to do with wheat or ears—the name is a twist on the old phrase 'white arse,' pointing to the bird's distinctive white rump found in most species. The northern wheatear weighs less than an ounce, but travels thousands of miles between its summer homes in Alaska and northern Canada to its wintering grounds in Africa. Its migration route is one of the longest for a bird its size. Unlike many backyard songbirds, wheatears prefer wide-open spaces with low vegetation, where they can sprint and pounce on insects. And while most North American birders might only catch them in the far north, wheatears are widespread across Europe, Asia, and Africa."></a>
