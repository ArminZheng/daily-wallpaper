    <a id="background" href="https://github.com" title="From warm hugs to wise guidance, moms give it all. Mother's Day is a time to honor the women who shape our lives, celebrating motherhood, unbreakable bonds, and their lasting impact on society. While the modern American version of this holiday began in the early 20th century, the celebration of motherhood has existed for centuries across cultures. Social activist Anna Jarvis led the inaugural Mother's Day worship service in 1908 at Andrews Methodist Episcopal Church in Grafton, West Virginia, now home to the International Mother's Day Shrine."></a>
