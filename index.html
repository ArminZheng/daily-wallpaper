    <a id="background" href="https://github.com" title="One moment they're blending in, the next they're flaunting a new shade—chameleons really know how to color the world. But every May 9, these masters of disguise can't hide from the spotlight. International Chameleon Day celebrates their color-shifting skills, zippy tongues, and wild adaptations. Chameleons change colors to help regulate their body temperature, attract mates, and communicate with others. Specialized skin cells, including iridophores, reflect light to create dazzling displays. Some species turn bright to signal aggression, while others adopt subdued tones to avoid attention."></a>
