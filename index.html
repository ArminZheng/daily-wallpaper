    <a id="background" href="https://github.com" title="Cinco de Mayo, or the Fifth of May, marks the Mexican army's victory over France at the Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862. While it is only celebrated sporadically in Mexico, it has become a vibrant celebration of Mexican culture and heritage in the US, especially in cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston. This holiday is often mistaken for Mexican Independence Day, but that falls on September 16. Instead, Cinco de Mayo honors Mexico's fight against foreign rule and symbolizes resilience and unity. The battle itself was brief, lasting from daybreak to early evening, but the Mexican army, led by General Ignacio Zaragoza, managed to defeat a much larger and better-equipped French force. Today, Cinco de Mayo festivities feature parades, mariachi music, folk dancing, and delicious foods like tacos and mole poblano. Whether you're joining a festival or just enjoying a plate of Mexican cuisine, it's a great day to appreciate Mexico's rich history and traditions. Viva Mexico!"></a>
