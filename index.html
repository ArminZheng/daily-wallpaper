    <a id="background" href="https://github.com" title="Today, we're in the Austrian city of Salzburg, a place that never goes out of style. The Advent season here creates a magical atmosphere, making it a truly unforgettable time to visit this city. Twinkling decorations bring the place to life, and the cozy scents of warm chestnuts, mulled wine, and freshly baked cookies mingle in the air. During this time, Salzburger Christkindlmarkt, a world-famous traditional Advent market, is hosted here. Seen on the hill in today's image is the Hohensalzburg Fortress, home to the popular Fortress Advent market, brimming with holiday cheer."></a>
