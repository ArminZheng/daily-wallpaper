    <a id="background" href="https://github.com" title="Watch closely; you might catch a glimpse of the black-naped monarch. This bird is part of the monarch flycatcher family, which also includes shrikebills, magpie-larks, and paradise flycatchers. Found across tropical southern Asia, from Iran and Sri Lanka to Indonesia and the Philippines, the black-naped monarch prefers dense forests and other lush, wooded spots. It perches upright on its short legs and spends most of its time catching insects in midair. These birds occupy the dense understory of the forest canopy."></a>
