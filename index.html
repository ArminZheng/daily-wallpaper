    <a id="background" href="https://github.com" title="New Year celebrations don't always come with fireworks—sometimes, they come with buckets and a nationwide water splash fest! Thailand's Songkran festival is a unique mix of spiritual traditions and all-out water fights. Held from April 13 to 15 this year, the holiday is deeply rooted in Buddhist customs and focuses on cleansing and starting afresh. During this time, people visit temples, offer food to monks, and pour scented water over Buddha statues and elders' hands as a sign of respect. Meanwhile, the streets turn into water battlegrounds, with locals and tourists alike getting soaked in the spirit of renewal. Traditional parades roll through the lanes, and in some places, the 'Lady Songkran' or 'Miss Songkran' contest steals the show, with contestants dressed in stunning Thai outfits."></a>
