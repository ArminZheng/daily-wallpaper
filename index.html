    <a id="background" href="https://github.com" title="In the shadow of Mount Rainier, a carpet of wildflowers bursts into life. Every summer, the meadows around this mountain are colored with vivid shades of blooming subalpine flowers: purple asters, pink coralroot, and yellow tiger lilies, and more. Also known as Tahoma, at over 14,400 feet, Mount Rainier is the tallest mountain in the state of Washington. It is covered by 36 square miles of glaciers and permanent snowfields, the highest glacier ice cover of any mountain in the lower 48 states."></a>
