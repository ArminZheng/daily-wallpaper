    <a id="background" href="https://github.com" title="The European river otter is more than just an adorable face in the wild. Found across Europe, Asia, and parts of northern Africa, these otters thrive in clean rivers, lakes, and wetlands, serving as an important indicator of environmental health. They are built for agility, with streamlined bodies, webbed feet, and dense fur that keeps them warm even in icy waters. A single square inch of their fur can hold more than 400,000 hairs, making it one of nature's most effective insulators. River otters were once endangered due to pollution and habitat loss. Thanks to conservation efforts, their populations are rebounding in many regions across Europe."></a>
