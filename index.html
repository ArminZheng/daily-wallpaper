    <a id="background" href="https://github.com" title="Today's image takes us to a city that is bold, unpolished in the best way, and brimming with personality. While it's famous for its port wine (cheers to that!), there's so much more to discover in the Portuguese city of Porto. As you walk through its streets, you'll notice façades adorned with azulejos—painted tin-glazed ceramic tilework found in Portugal and Spain—historic churches like São Francisco, and the iconic Dom Luís I Bridge spanning the Douro River, which runs through the city."></a>
