    <a id="background" href="https://github.com" title="Get ready for a starry Moroccan night! Stargazing here is truly magical, as the vast skies and minimal light pollution transform each evening into a dazzling display. Every star you see is part of our galaxy, the Milky Way, which appears as a creamy band of light in the darkest skies. In today's image, you can see this cosmic beauty glowing over Aït Benhaddou, a historic fortified village known as a ksar, in the Ouarzazate province of Morocco. This site was first fortified in the 11th century. It was a key stop on the ancient caravan trade route connecting the Sahara and the city of Marrakesh. Perched on a hillside by the Ounila River, this village is a cluster of buildings encircled by a protective wall, complete with towers and a gate."></a>
