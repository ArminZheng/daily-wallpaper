    <a id="background" href="https://github.com" title="Welcome to Katahdin, where dense woodlands and pristine waterways stretch out as far as the eye can see. Covering nearly 87,500 acres, this new national monument was established eight years ago today. Maine's logging industry was a big part of this region for over a hundred years but declined toward the end of the 19th century. Efforts to preserve its landscape were spearheaded by philanthropist Roxanne Quimby. She started buying land near Baxter State Park in 2001 and donated it to the federal government in 2016, ensuring its preservation for future generations."></a>
