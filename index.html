    <a id="background" href="https://github.com" title="As fall covers the landscape with amber hues and the chill of Halloween approaches, it's time to start carving some spooky jack-o'-lanterns. Originally from Ireland and Scotland, this craft was brought to America by immigrants who initially made lanterns from turnips and potatoes but later found pumpkins more plentiful and easier to carve. Once hollowed out and lit with candles, the gourds were transformed into flickering defenses against evil spirits."></a>
