    <a id="background" href="https://github.com" title="Perched on the edge of a basalt cliff above two rivers, today's image takes us to Castellfollit de la Roca, in the Spanish region of Catalonia. This town is not for the faint-hearted: There's a 160-foot drop down to the Toronell and Fluvia Rivers, which converge at the base of the cliff. Many of the buildings, which are made of the same basalt that the town stands on, seem to teeter on the edge of the precipice. Pictured at the end of the crag is the 13th-century church of Sant Salvador."></a>
