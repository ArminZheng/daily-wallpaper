    <a id="background" href="https://github.com" title="Mars, the fourth planet from the sun, is often referred to as the 'Red Planet' due to its rusty hue from the iron oxide-rich soil dust. The planet is dotted with frosty dunes, largely located in the high latitudes of the northern plains. Mars' atmosphere is composed of nearly 96% carbon dioxide, which is why carbon ice forms on the surface. These dunes showcase the dynamic interaction between Mars' thin atmosphere, its surface, and seasonal temperature changes."></a>
