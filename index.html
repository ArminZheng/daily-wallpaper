    <a id="background" href="https://github.com" title="High up in the Pyrenees, there is a gap in the mountains. More than 300 feet tall and 131 feet across, La Brecha de Rolando (Roland's Breach), featured here today, is a sight to behold. But who was Roland? Count Roland was a Frankish military leader during Charlemagne's reign in the 8th century. Legend has it that, after being defeated in battle, Roland cut a gap in the mountains—either to destroy his sword or to catch one last glimpse of France."></a>
