    <a id="background" href="https://github.com" title="Perched dramatically on a tidal islet in Loch Laich, Argyll, Castle Stalker is one of Scotland's most picturesque and well-preserved medieval tower houses. Built around the 1440s by the Stewarts of Appin, its history includes royal visits and even a drunken wager that briefly transferred ownership to Clan Campbell. After falling into disrepair by the 19th century, it was lovingly restored in the mid-20th century and is still privately owned today. Visitors can explore this historic site on selected guided tours during the summer."></a>
