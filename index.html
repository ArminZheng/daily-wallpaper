    <a id="background" href="https://github.com" title="Zahara de la Sierra, a stunning whitewashed village in the hills of Cádiz province in Spain, offers a blend of history and nature in the south of the Iberian Peninsula. Perched on a rocky hilltop, the village seen in today's image overlooks the Zahara-El Gastor Reservoir and the Sierra de Grazalema Natural Park, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve since 1977. Its Moorish castle ruins and 15th-century tower reflect its history as a medieval fortress. Stroll through streets lined with flower-filled balconies, visit the church of Santa María de la Mesa, or simply relax and take in the views. Zahara is also a gateway to adventure—activities like hiking, cycling, and kayaking are only a little of what the village has to offer."></a>
