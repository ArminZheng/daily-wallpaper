    <a id="background" href="https://github.com" title="It's time to bust out the furry feet and pointed ears because today is J.R.R. Tolkien Day, celebrating the literary legend behind 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'The Hobbit.' On January 3, the Tolkien Society toasts 'the professor' on his birthday, echoing Frodo's annual toasts to Bilbo on his birthday each year. Tolkien's roots run through Oxford, where he studied English language and literature and later became a professor. Since 1979, Oxford's Bodleian Library has been home to the Tolkien Archive, a collection of manuscripts, artwork, and even a Middle-earth map with Tolkien's handwritten notes. His legacy is one of timeless fantastical tales that have delighted generations of readers since they were written more than 70 years ago. His stories encourage us to seize each day and make the most of the time that is given to us."></a>
