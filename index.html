    <a id="background" href="https://github.com" title="Today, the country remembers 'a date which will live in infamy.' President Franklin D. Roosevelt spoke these words to Congress in 1941, the day after Japan's attack on the Pearl Harbor naval base in Oahu, Hawaii. The destruction inflicted on the US Pacific Fleet is one of military history's most devastating surprise attacks. More than 3,500 US servicepeople were killed or wounded, and eight battleships were destroyed or damaged in less than two hours. Following Roosevelt's speech came a declaration of war and the entrance of the US into World War II. Congress named December 7 National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day in 1994."></a>
