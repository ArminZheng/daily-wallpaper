    <a id="background" href="https://github.com" title="Diwali is a vibrant Hindu festival celebrating hope, prosperity, and the triumph of good over evil. It commemorates Prince Rama's victorious return to the kingdom of Ayodhya after defeating the demon king Ravana. The festival also honors the goddess Lakshmi, who is believed to bring wealth and well-being into homes, while some communities worship the goddess Kali. During Diwali, families clean and decorate their homes, exchange sweets, and gather for prayers, creating an atmosphere of joy. Central to the celebration are diyas, small oil lamps whose glowing flames symbolize light overcoming darkness and the promise of new beginnings."></a>
