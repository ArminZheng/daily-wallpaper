    <a id="background" href="https://github.com" title="Discover the beauty of Vancouver Island, Canada. The wooden pathway in today's image, surrounded by ancient pine and cedar trees, leads to Kennedy Lake, the largest freshwater body on the island. The lake covers a surface area of 16,000 acres. It is part of the ancestral lands of the Tla-o-qui-aht First Nation where the Clayoquot and Kennedy Rivers meet. Tofino, over 24 miles away, has a real surf vibe. This small coastal town is a sanctuary for hikers, bird watchers, artists, and dreamers. Famous for its mild winters and pleasant summers, it has been a filming location for movies like 'The Twilight Saga: New Moon' and 'One Week.'"></a>
