    <a id="background" href="https://github.com" title="The lush greenery of June is here, and so is National Rivers Month, a 30-day tribute to the veins of our planet that was created by Canadian activist Mark Angelo. Just like the confluence featured here today, where Alaska's Easter Creek and Killik River unite in a beautiful display, we too come together every year to help preserve the nation's rivers. With increasing threats such as pollution, habitat destruction, and overuse, it's more important than ever to advocate for the protection of our waterways. Whether you're paddling down a gentle stream, casting a line for some fishing fun, or simply enjoying a leisurely stroll along the riverbank, there are countless ways to connect with these flowing wonders. The US alone boasts a vast network of over 250,000 rivers that stretches more than 3 million miles across diverse terrains. Which one are you heading to?"></a>
