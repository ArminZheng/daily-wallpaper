    <a id="background" href="https://github.com" title="When the sun clocks out in streaks of orange, pink, and purple, Santa Monica goes from laid-back to lit up. Literally. With over 3 miles of sand, a historic pier, and the Pacific Coast Highway keeping things scenic, this beach is more than just a pretty shoreline. Let's start with the sand. Wide, clean, and ready for volleyball or just flopping down with a good book, it's ideal for sunbathers and sandcastle architects alike. And yes, 'Baywatch' was filmed along Santa Monica Bay. Feel free to run in slow motion."></a>
