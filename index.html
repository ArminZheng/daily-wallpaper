    <a id="background" href="https://github.com" title="At Lake Tyrrell, in southern Australia, the sky meets the Earth in a dazzling display. The state of Victoria's largest salt lake was formed around 120,000 years ago. Over time, climate changes caused water levels to drop; these days, the lake is normally dry, except in winter when it's covered in about 2 inches of water. The name 'Tyrrell' comes from the local Wergaia word for 'sky,' a nod to the Boorong Aboriginal People's interest in astronomy. Spanning more than 70 square miles, Lake Tyrrell is a haven for wildlife, including kangaroos, emus, and various reptiles."></a>
