    <a id="background" href="https://github.com" title="Plum blossoms, inspiration for countless artists and writers, bloom as symbols of endurance and elegance. The flowers of the Prunus mume tree bloom in late winter to early spring. Native to China, the species has been introduced to Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. Found in China's iconic spots like Nanjing's Plum Blossom Mountain, Wuhan's East Lake, and Hangzhou's West Lake, these fleeting blooms attract visitors eager to witness their ephemeral magic. In Chinese culture, plum blossoms represent purity and the arrival of spring, whereas in Japan, they symbolize new beginnings. With over 300 varieties, this tree can thrive in gardens of all sizes, offering a variety of shapes and colors. Beyond their visual appeal, plum blossoms are also used in traditional cuisine, such as floral teas and preserved plums."></a>
