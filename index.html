Passed in the US in 1973, this law was a game-changer, ensuring that economic growth wouldn't steamroll over species at risk of disappearing forever. For the first time, plants were given protection too, and the focus shifted from merely avoiding extinction to actively helping species recover to the point where they could thrive without protection."></a>
