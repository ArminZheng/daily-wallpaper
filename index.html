    <a id="background" href="https://github.com" title="January 15, 1759, marked the opening of a place that would become the pride of London, a hub of global history, and a keeper of countless stories: the British Museum. For the first time, a national museum flung its doors wide open, offering free access to knowledge and culture for all. The story begins with Sir Hans Sloane, an Anglo-Irish physician and avid collector. His collection of more than 71,000 items, ranging from books and manuscripts to botanical samples and antiquities, formed the museum's foundation. Fast-forward nearly 266 years, and the museum houses more than 8 million objects, the largest collection of artifacts in the world, although only about 1% of the collection is currently on display. Its treasures span continents and millennia, from the Rosetta Stone—key to deciphering ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs—to the Parthenon Marbles, the Benin Bronzes, and samurai armor."></a>
