    <a id="background" href="https://github.com" title="Playful, strong swimmers, and expert hunters—meet the otters. They come in 13 species of various shapes and sizes, from the sea otters found in coastal waters to the river otters frolicking in freshwater habitats. Seen in today's image is a Eurasian otter on the beautiful Isle of Mull off the west coast of Scotland. With webbed feet, streamlined bodies, and dense fur coats, otters are built for speed and agility underwater. They can dive deep and hold their breath for several minutes."></a>
