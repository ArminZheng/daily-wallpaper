    <a id="background" href="https://github.com" title="Tombeau du Géant in Bouillon, Belgium, offers a picturesque panorama for those who make the journey to see it. The Giant's Tomb, as the hill is known in English, resembles a giant resting in the crook of the 130-mile-long Semois River. The name originates from a local legend about a Gallic giant, Treviso, who chose to leap off the cliffs of Rocher des Gattes rather than be captured by Roman soldiers. This vantage point, popular among hikers and road-trippers, provides a view that shifts dramatically with the seasons. During autumn, the landscape dons warm colors, as seen in today's image, making it an ideal spot for nature enthusiasts and photographers."></a>
