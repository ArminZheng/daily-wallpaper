    <a id="background" href="https://github.com" title="Every July, nature enthusiasts gather for National Moth Week to celebrate the beauty and diversity of moths. Featured in today's image is the luna moth, a species whose charm rivals that of butterflies. Also known as the American moon moth, this striking insect—with its lime-green wings and white body—can be found across North America. Its caterpillars are also green and known for their impressive size, as well as their ability to emit clicking sounds and regurgitate intestinal contents as a defense mechanism against predators."></a>
