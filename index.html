    <a id="background" href="https://github.com" title="Striking appearance, strong presence, and impressive antlers—meet the red deer, photographed in the ancient forests of Glen Affric, one of Scotland's most beautiful valleys. Found across Europe, Asia, and parts of North Africa, this species is Britain's largest land mammal and an integral part of the Caledonian pinewoods, Scotland's coniferous forests. From featuring in cave art found throughout Europe to medieval hunting traditions, red deer have always held a special place in the human imagination. In many parts of the world, their image is synonymous with the wild, free spirit of nature. Glen Affric, with its lochs, moorlands, and mountains, provides the perfect habitat for these magnificent creatures. This national nature reserve is also popular with hikers, climbers, and nature enthusiasts."></a>
