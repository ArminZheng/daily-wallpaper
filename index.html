These tiny winged workers are running the world's sweetest gig—and they've got a whole day dedicated to their buzz-ness. Welcome to World Honey Bee Day, celebrated every third Saturday in August. About 35% of global food crop production relies on animal pollination, including honey bees. The value of crops pollinated by bees is estimated at hundreds of billions of dollars. Despite their superpowers, bees are in a sticky situation. Habitat loss, pesticides, disease, and climate change are making life in the hive less than ideal."></a>
