    <a id="background" href="https://github.com" title="Fifty-five years ago today, an act of resistance marked a turning point in the fight for LGBTQIA+ rights. In the early hours of June 28, 1969, New York City Police raided the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in Greenwich Village. At the time, homosexuality was illegal, and such raids were common. However, that night, the patrons of the Stonewall Inn, fed up with the continued harassment, stood their ground. Violence escalated, leading to clashes between protesters and police. In the following days, there was more rioting as people gathered to protest the raids."></a>
