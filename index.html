    <a id="background" href="https://github.com" title="From mythology to movies, lizards have often been portrayed as scary reptiles. But they're not as dangerous as stories might lead you to believe. World Lizard Day is the perfect time to learn about these cold-blooded creatures. With more than 7,000 species, lizards have adapted to a wide range of environments—from deserts to rainforests. Take geckos—these little climbers have toe pads that let them scale walls and walk on ceilings. Then there are chameleons with their color-changing skin. While many think it's all about blending in, this ability is also used to communicate and regulate temperature."></a>
