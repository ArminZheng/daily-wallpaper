Found in the Americas, Asia, Africa, and parts of Europe, these birds are often seen wading through wetlands, tidal flats, and quiet streams. Patient and precise, they stand motionless for minutes, waiting for just the right moment to deliver a lightning-fast strike. Fish are their main prey, but they also eat frogs, reptiles, and even small mammals."></a>
