    <a id="background" href="https://github.com" title="Every autumn, many of the 18,000 trees in Central Park, New York, are painted in shades of yellow, red, and orange. It's one of Central Park's most photographed seasons, and fall in the park has provided iconic backdrops for movies like 'When Harry Met Sally…' and 'Hair.' Trees sense the coming of winter not only by temperature, but by the angle at which sunlight hits their leaves. Because of New York's buildings, the unique interaction of light, shadows, and temperatures often results in fall foliage occurring later in the park than the rest of the city."></a>
